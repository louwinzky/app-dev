# The Matrix

The Matrix is a 1999 science fiction action film written and directed by the Wachowskis.
It is the first installment in the Matrix film series, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, 
Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano, and depicts a dystopian future in which humanity 
is unknowingly trapped inside the Matrix, a simulated reality that intelligent machines have created 
to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source.

The Matrix is an example of the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction.
